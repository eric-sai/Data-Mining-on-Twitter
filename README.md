# Data-Mining-on-Twitter
Improve search for Twitter by considering text pattern recognition and social influence
The current Twitter search has so many problems. It cannot return efficient results with ambiguous words or misunderstanding key-word.
However, after putting the text pattern recognition and social influence like retweet, reply, hash or mention, the search engine will return more correlated results.
This whole project is based on python.
